# GameVerse Project Page

This repository contains the source code for the GameVerse project page.

## Overview

GameVerse is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in diverse gaming environments. This project page serves as the official website to showcase the research, methodology, and evaluation results.

## Content Structure

The project page includes the following key sections:

- **Abstract & Introduction**: Overview of the GameVerse benchmark and its significance.
- **Methodology**: Details on the dual action space, video-based reflection paradigm, and scalable evaluation protocol.
- **15 Games Evaluation**: A 5x3 grid showcasing VLM performance across 15 popular video games, categorized by cognitive and difficulty tiers.
- **Models vs. Human Comparison**: Side-by-side gameplay comparisons between Qwen3-VL-32B-instruct, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Human players across 5 representative games.
- **Video-based Reflection (VR) Comparison**: Demonstrations of gameplay improvements before and after applying the VR paradigm, featuring detailed case studies for Tic-Tac-Toe, Angry Birds, and Plants vs. Zombies.
- **Leaderboard & Results**: Quantitative evaluation results of various VLMs.

## Local Development

To view the project page locally, simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No build process or local server is strictly required, though using a simple local server (like `python -m http.server` or VS Code Live Server) is recommended for the best experience with local video files.
